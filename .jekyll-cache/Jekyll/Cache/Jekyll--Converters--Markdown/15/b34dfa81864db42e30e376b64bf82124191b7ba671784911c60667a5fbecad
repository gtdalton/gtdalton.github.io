I"¹<p>I have created this site using Jekyll which is a static site generator that syncs well with Github.  A static site generator creates webpages by combining â€˜contentâ€™ and â€˜themesâ€™ to produce website files that can be uploaded to a server.  This allows the user to be able to easily produce new content and allow the styling to be managed by your chosen theme.  I selected the Reked theme for Jekyll created by <a href="http://artemsheludko.com/">Artem Sheludko</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/artemshelduko.png" alt="Artem Shelduko Home Page" />
<em>Site contains links to several free and premium themes</em></p>

<p>I also found the following resources very useful</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://jekyll-themes.com/">Jeckyl-Themes.com</a> for browsing through different themes</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQsGdCWv4I">Giraffe Academy</a> for getting up and running with Jekyll in the first place</li>
  <li>And of course the official documentation on the Jekyll pages</li>
</ol>

<p>Since this is my first post, and I am experimenting, here is a quote:</p>
