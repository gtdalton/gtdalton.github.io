I happened across this book whilst digging out some statistics and health informatics books from UCL's medical school library.  Whilst the course textbooks received between a cursory glance and a scrutinization of only a few chapters, this book engaged me from cover to cover.

Whilst focusing on the US health system, Wachter expertly explains what has gone wrong during the implementation of computers into clinical settings, what has caused this, and how it might be fixed to create a future where doctors work is aided rather than hindered by technology.  There are many idiosyncrasies of the US health system compared to the NHS which I had previously heard of but not understood: for example, Wachter tells of how the co-incidental timing of the 2008 financial crisis meant that large public projects needed to be created to help the financial system, at a period when many hospitals were looking to go digital.  Cue HIPAA and large funds to be given to organisations that were ready to deliver on helping health providers implement IT systems, without too much scrutiny of how beneficial these systems would actually be!
