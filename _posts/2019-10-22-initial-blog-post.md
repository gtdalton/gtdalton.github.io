I have created this site using Jekyll which is a static site generator that syncs well with Github.  A static site generator creates webpages by combining 'content' and 'themes' to produce website files that can be uploaded to a server.  This allows the user to be able to easily produce new content and allow the styling to be managed by your chosen theme.  I selected the Reked theme for Jekyll created by [Artem Sheludko](http://artemsheludko.com/).

*Site contains links to several free and premium themes*

I also found the following resources very useful
1. [Jeckyl-Themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/) for browsing through different themes
2. [Giraffe Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDQsGdCWv4I) for getting up and running with Jekyll in the first place
3. And of course the official documentation on the Jekyll pages

Since this is my first post, and I am experimenting, here is a quote:
